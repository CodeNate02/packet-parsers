# packet-parsers
Two Python-based scripts to compute metrics from a set of packet captures created in Spring 2021 as assignments for the course "Task Automation using Interpretive Languages"
#Group Project Version
The group project version of this assignment was completed as a group of 4 students.  We split the 3 "parts" of the assignment (Filtering, Analyzing, and Metrics) into teams.  I worked on the computing section of the assignment.
After the group turned in a completed version of the assignment, the team let me persue the extra-credit version of the project and rework our Analysis script to read the raw hex data from the packets.
#Individual Take-Home
As a take-home final exam, the professor gave us a similar assignment as a solo project, this time using Scapy to analyze the packets for us.
